# Prompt Injection & Tokenization

Prompt injection attacks exploit how text is tokenized.

## Common Techniques

- Unicode homoglyphs
- Invisible characters
- Token boundary manipulation

## Defense

- Token-level sanitization
- Normalization filters
- Token anomaly detection

Tokenization is both the vulnerability and the defense layer.
