# Adaptive Tokenization

Future LLMs may adapt tokenization dynamically.

## Ideas

- Context-aware token merging
- Domain-specific vocabularies
- Runtime token optimization

Adaptive tokenization improves efficiency and security.

# Security-Aware LLMs

Next-gen LLMs will integrate:

- Token-level threat detection
- Secure token filters
- Adversarial robustness

Tokenization will become a first-class security control.
