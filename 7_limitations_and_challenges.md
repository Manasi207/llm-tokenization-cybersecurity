# Bias and Vocabulary Limitations

Tokenizers inherit bias from training data.

## Issues

- Over-representation of dominant languages
- Poor handling of minority dialects
- Semantic fragmentation

Bias mitigation must start at the tokenizer level.

# Adversarial Token Attacks

Attackers craft inputs to exploit token boundaries.

## Examples

- Token flooding
- Rare token abuse
- Encoding mismatches

These attacks impact reliability and safety of LLM systems.
